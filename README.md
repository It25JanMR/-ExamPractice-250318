## How to create bootable usb
### To create a bootable USB drive for installing Windows 10, follow these steps:
- Download the Windows 10 ISO
- Visit the official Microsoft website and download the Windows 10 ISO. This file is necessary for creating the bootable USB.
- Prepare Your USB Drive
-  Insert a USB flash drive with at least 8GB of free space into your computer. Make sure to back up any important files from the USB drive as it will be formatted during the process.
-  Use the Media Creation Tool
-  Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Microsoft’s website.
-  Launch the tool, accept the terms, and then choose the option to create installation media for another PC.
-  Select the appropriate language, edition, and architecture (either 32-bit or 64-bit) for your system.
-  Choose “USB flash drive” when prompted and then select your USB drive from the list.
-  Let the tool download Windows 10 and create the bootable USB.
## Alternatively, you can use Rufus, a free third-party tool, to create the bootable USB:
 - Download the ISO File
- As before, download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft’s website
- Download and Open Rufus
- Download and run the latest version of Rufus (no installation required).
- Set Up Rufus
- In Rufus, select your USB flash drive under “Device”.
- Under “Boot selection”, choose the Windows 10 ISO you downloaded.
- Choose either GPT or MBR for partition scheme based on your system's compatibility.
- Set the file system to “FAT32” or “NTFS”, depending on the size of the ISO file (FAT32 for smaller ISOs, NTFS for larger files).
- Create the Bootable USB
- Click “Start” and confirm any prompts.
- Wait for the process to complete. Once it’s done, your USB drive will be bootable and ready for use.
